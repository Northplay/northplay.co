      <h3>Building an Award Winning Game</h3>
      <p>The journey of making Conduct THIS! was like any good movie: full of thrilling suspense, long nights and hard work. Our small team laboured passionately for months to create an experience that would satisfy the kid inside us.</p>
      <p>In <a href="http://www.postmortem.fm/5-conduct" target="_blank">the episode</a> of the podcast <a href="http://www.postmortem.fm/" target="_blank">Postmortem</a> below, we discuss the origin of the game and what we learned along the way. We talk about how a great premise combined with a restrictive process helped us design a game that would go on to be experienced by millions of people.</p>
